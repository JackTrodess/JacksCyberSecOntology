## Overview

JacksCyberSecOntology is a comprehensive cybersecurity framework that integrates attack path analysis with compliance requirements for KRITIS operators and cybersecurity professionals. It provides quantitative risk assessment capabilities while mapping to international standards (ISO 27001, NIST CSF) and German/EU legal requirements (NIS2, CRA, BSIG).

## Key Features

- **93 Security Controls** across 4 domains (OpSec, TechSec, PhySec, HumSec)
- **MITRE ATT&CK Integration** with tactic mappings (TA0001-TA0011)
- **Attack Path Simulation** with quantitative success probability calculation
- **German Legal Compliance** (BSIG, KRITISDachG, NIS2UmsuCG)
- **EU Framework Integration** (NIS2, CRA, CER directives)
- **Supply Chain Risk Analysis** with IRAM2-based methodology
- **Vulnerability Intelligence** (EPSS scores, KEV status, CVE integration)

## Files Included

2. **JacksCyberSecOntology.db** - SQLite database with views and indices (233,472 bytes)
3. **README.md** - This documentation
5. **CHANGELOG.md** - Complete development history
